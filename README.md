# Student Management System

## Overview
The Student Management System is a web application designed to manage student information, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records. This project is built using a combination of React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with MySQL as the database system.

## Features
This system offers the following features:

- **Interactive User Interface**: We have designed and built an interactive and responsive user interface using React.js to provide an excellent user experience.

- **CRUD Operations**: The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student entities. This means you can easily add new students, view their information, update their records, and remove them when necessary.

- **RESTful API**: We have created a RESTful API using Spring Boot to handle the backend operations. This API facilitates communication between the frontend and the database, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of data.

- **Database Management**: The system efficiently stores and manages student data in a MySQL database. This ensures the reliability and persistence of student records.
